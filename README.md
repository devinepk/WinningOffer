# Winning Offer

Winning Offer is an application that will let real estate agents write offers from their phone in under 3 minutes.

## The problem

When I was a real estate agent, time was my most valuable commodity.  Being able to write and submit an offer, while the buyers still felt the magic, was crucial.

The technology to do that, however, was gone.  I either had to open my laptop and tether off of my phone, find the nearest coffee shop for WIFI, or go on to my next showing until I had 20 or 30 minutes to sit down and write the offer.

## The solution
A web application that let's the agent make an offer from their phone, while they're still in the home, with the buyers, in under 3 minutes.


## Technology + Services
- C# (primary language)
- Microsoft .Net Core 5.0 (primary framework)
- Microsoft Entity Framework 5.0.4 (database CRUD operations)
- Amazon RDS (SQL db)
- RestSharp (API calls to multiple 3rd party services)
- Datafiniti API (real-time real estate listings)
- ...more will be added as I use them
